''' <para>In order to run and test this plugin it must be integrated within the EwE6 scientific interface. 
''' To achieve this, add this project to the EwE6 solution, and reference this project from within the 
''' ScientificInterface. This ensures that your plug-in will be built with EwE6, and will be loaded by the 
''' EwE6 plug-in manager when you run EwE6.</para>
