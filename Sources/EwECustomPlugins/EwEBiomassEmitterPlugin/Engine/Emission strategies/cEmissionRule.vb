        ' In Skype discussions with Joachim Claudet we have been yet unable to fnid a working approach that
        ' crosses the divide between the Zupan et al approach and EwE.
        ' - Zupan's formulas account for all MPA effects since establishment: size, age, lack of fishing, etc
        ' - Ecospace implicitly accounts for age, and fishing mortality is already controlled through MPA enforcement
        ' As such, Zupan-derived formulas grossly overestimate biomasses in Ecospace. We need to mitigate this effect

        ' As discussed with Marta Coll, it seems more realistic to have biomass increases in the order of 5% when
        ' in a MPA when the MPA is too small for Ecospace to account for its workings.

        ' How this code should work:
        ' - The MPA size (in HA) must be translated to the amount of area covered by an MPA, per cell, somehow
        ' - As a solution, the MPA size (converted to km2) is divided by the average cell size (in km2) in Ecospace (latitude tapering is igored).
        ' - Cell area coverage determines the magnitue of biomass boost that the cell will receive due to the presence of the effective sub-cell MPA
        ' - The MPA cell area coverage is capped at 1
        ' - The total effect is applied up to 4 cells. From 4 to 16 cells there is a linear decrease to 0. At 16 cells, Ecospace is fully capable of emulating the MPA
