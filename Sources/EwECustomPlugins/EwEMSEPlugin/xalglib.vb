    ' This family of functions is used to launcn iterations of nonlinear optimizer
    ' 
    ' These functions accept following parameters:
    '     func    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
    '                 value func at given point x
    '     grad    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
    '                 value func and gradient grad at given point x
    '     rep     -   optional callback which is called after each iteration
    '                 can be null
    '     obj     -   optional object which is passed to func/grad/hess/jac/rep
    '                 can be null
    ' 
    ' 
    ' NOTES:
    ' 
    ' 1. This function has two different implementations: one which  uses  exact
    '    (analytical) user-supplied  gradient, and one which uses function value
    '    only  and  numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain
    '    gradient.
    ' 
    '    Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
    '    (either MinCGCreate()  for analytical gradient  or  MinCGCreateF()  for
    '    numerical differentiation) you should  choose  appropriate  variant  of
    '    MinCGOptimize() - one which accepts function AND gradient or one  which
    '    accepts function ONLY.
    ' 
    '    Be careful to choose variant of MinCGOptimize()  which  corresponds  to
    '    your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
    '    callback (function/gradient) passed  to  MinCGOptimize()  and  specific
    '    function used to create optimizer.
    ' 
    ' 
    '                   |         USER PASSED TO MinCGOptimize()
    '    CREATED WITH   |  function only   |  function and gradient
    '    ------------------------------------------------------------
    '    MinCGCreateF() |     work                FAIL
    '    MinCGCreate()  |     FAIL                work
    ' 
    '    Here "FAIL" denotes inappropriate combinations  of  optimizer  creation
    '    function and MinCGOptimize() version. Attemps to use  such  combination
    '    (for  example,  to create optimizer with  MinCGCreateF()  and  to  pass
    '    gradient information to MinCGOptimize()) will lead to  exception  being
    '    thrown. Either  you  did  not  pass  gradient when it WAS needed or you
    '    passed gradient when it was NOT needed.

    ' This family of functions is used to launcn iterations of nonlinear optimizer

    ' 
    ' 1. This function has two different implementations: one which  uses  exact
    '    (analytical) user-supplied gradient,  and one which uses function value
    '    only  and  numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain
    '    gradient.

    '    Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
    '    (either  MinBLEICCreate() for analytical gradient or  MinBLEICCreateF()
    '    for numerical differentiation) you should choose appropriate variant of
    '    MinBLEICOptimize() - one  which  accepts  function  AND gradient or one
    '    which accepts function ONLY.
    ' 
    '    Be careful to choose variant of MinBLEICOptimize() which corresponds to
    '    your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
    '    callback (function/gradient) passed to MinBLEICOptimize()  and specific
    '    function used to create optimizer.

    '    MinBLEICCreate()  |     FAIL                work
    ' 
    '    Here "FAIL" denotes inappropriate combinations  of  optimizer  creation
    '    function  and  MinBLEICOptimize()  version.   Attemps   to   use   such
    '    combination (for  example,  to  create optimizer with MinBLEICCreateF()

    '    only  and  numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain
    '    gradient.

    '    Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
    '    (either MinLBFGSCreate() for analytical gradient  or  MinLBFGSCreateF()
    '    for numerical differentiation) you should choose appropriate variant of
    '    MinLBFGSOptimize() - one  which  accepts  function  AND gradient or one
    '    which accepts function ONLY.
    ' 
    '    Be careful to choose variant of MinLBFGSOptimize() which corresponds to
    '    your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
    '    callback (function/gradient) passed to MinLBFGSOptimize()  and specific
    '    function used to create optimizer.

    '    function  and  MinLBFGSOptimize()  version.   Attemps   to   use   such
    '    combination (for example, to create optimizer with MinLBFGSCreateF() and

    ' 
    ' 1. Depending on function used to create state  structure,  this  algorithm
    '    may accept Jacobian and/or Hessian and/or gradient.  According  to  the
    '    said above, there ase several versions of this function,  which  accept
    '    different sets of callbacks.
    ' 
    '    This flexibility opens way to subtle errors - you may create state with
    '    MinLMCreateFGH() (optimization using Hessian), but call function  which
    '    does not accept Hessian. So when algorithm will request Hessian,  there
    '    will be no callback to call. In this case exception will be thrown.
    ' 
    '    Be careful to avoid such errors because there is no way to find them at
    '    compile time - you can see them at runtime only.

    ' This family of functions is used to launcn iterations of nonlinear fitter
    ' 
    ' These functions accept following parameters:
    '     func    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
    '                 value func at given point x
    '     grad    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
    '                 value func and gradient grad at given point x
    '     hess    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
    '                 value func, gradient grad and Hessian hess at given point x
    '     rep     -   optional callback which is called after each iteration
    '                 can be null
    '     obj     -   optional object which is passed to func/grad/hess/jac/rep
    '                 can be null
    ' 
    ' 
    ' NOTES:
    ' 
    ' 1. this algorithm is somewhat unusual because it works with  parameterized
    '    function f(C,X), where X is a function argument (we  have  many  points
    '    which are characterized by different  argument  values),  and  C  is  a
    '    parameter to fit.
    ' 
    '    For example, if we want to do linear fit by f(c0,c1,x) = c0*x+c1,  then
    '    x will be argument, and {c0,c1} will be parameters.
    ' 
    '    It is important to understand that this algorithm finds minimum in  the
    '    space of function PARAMETERS (not arguments), so it  needs  derivatives
    '    of f() with respect to C, not X.
    ' 
    '    In the example above it will need f=c0*x+c1 and {df/dc0,df/dc1} = {x,1}
    '    instead of {df/dx} = {c0}.
    ' 
    ' 2. Callback functions accept C as the first parameter, and X as the second
    ' 
    ' 3. If  state  was  created  with  LSFitCreateFG(),  algorithm  needs  just
    '    function   and   its   gradient,   but   if   state   was  created with
    '    LSFitCreateFGH(), algorithm will need function, gradient and Hessian.
    ' 
    '    According  to  the  said  above,  there  ase  several  versions of this
    '    function, which accept different sets of callbacks.
    ' 
    '    This flexibility opens way to subtle errors - you may create state with
    '    LSFitCreateFGH() (optimization using Hessian), but call function  which
    '    does not accept Hessian. So when algorithm will request Hessian,  there
    '    will be no callback to call. In this case exception will be thrown.
    ' 
    '    Be careful to avoid such errors because there is no way to find them at
    '    compile time - you can see them at runtime only.
