            '       following:
            '         (1) Modify lines below as noted to name variables used by your
            '             model and data used in fitting, to set initial values
            '             for your parameter estimates x(1)...x(n), and number of
            '             parameters n to be estimated.
            '         (2) Fill in the subroutine called ReadData to name and read in
            '             any data that you want to use in the fitting; note your
            '             data variable name(s) must be declared in the SHARED statement
            '             below in this mainline program.  Note also that you cannot put
            '             DATA and READ statements in that subroutine; if you want to use
            '             that input approach, such statements must be in this mainline
            '             program, just below this starred instruction section.
            '         (3) Fill in the subroutine called func to generate your model
            '             predicted values and the value of the fitting criterion (eg,
            '             value of the sum of squares of deviations) given any values
            '             passed to the subroutine for the parameters x(1),...,x(n)
            '             by the Fletch subroutine; Fletch will call func with various
            '             values of the x's during its search for the x values that will
            '             minimize the fitting criterion.  Note that the last line in
            '             your func subroutine must be of the form func=xxx, where xxx is
            '             the calculated value of your fitting criterion.
            '         (4) the last call to func (after fitting is finished) will be with
            '             a variable called iprintresid set equal to 1 (it will be 0 for
            '             all other calls to func).  You might want to set up func so
            '             that it prints the observed and predicted values (or residuals)
            '             if iprintresid=1, perhaps to a file so that you can plot them.
            '             Alternatively, you might want to create a subroutine to print or
            '             plot them; in this case, call that routine right at the end of
            '             this main program.
