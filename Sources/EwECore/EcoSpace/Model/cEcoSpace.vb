    need to dimension global variables Pencon(Numgroups) as double, DoPenaltysearch as logical.  Then before call to 
    predicteffortdistirbution in findspatial equilibrium, redim Pencon(Numgroups), 
    And if DoPenaltySearch=True then call the following subroutine to set constants needed for penalty calculations

    Then in predicteffortdistributionthreaded, we use these pencon(ig) values to calculate a penalty cost for each gear for 
    fishing in each cell i,j in the loop that calculates Attract(ig,i,j), as:
    	Pencost=0
    For isp = 1 To EcoSpaceData.NGroups
                    Pencost = Pencost + Pencon(isp) * m_data.Bcell(i, j, isp) * m_SimData.relQ(iFlt, isp)
            Next
    This Pencost Is Then added To the denominator Of the Attract equation (along With 
    Effortcost And sailcost.

    This calculation can Throw very high pencost values For any group that Is initially badly overfished (Ftarget(isp)<<F
    predicted by ecospace before applying any penalties For exceeding ftarget.  Such high costs may cause the overall
    optimization search To "chatter" over time, from high To very low To high efforts.  To Stop this chatter, i think
    that all we need Do Is To prevent every Effort from dropping more than about 50% In any time Step.  The simple way To
    Do this Is to replace the effort prediction line:
    m_Data.EffortSpace(iFlt, i, j) = m_SimData.FishRateGear(iFlt, arguments.iCumMonth) * TotE * Attract(i, j) / TotAttract
    With three lines:
    Effpred = m_SimData.FishRateGear(iFlt, arguments.iCumMonth) * TotE * Attract(i, j) / TotAttract
    Effmin=0.5*m_Data.Effortspace(iflt,i,j)
    If Effpred < Effmin Then m_Data.EffortSpace(Iflt,i,j)=Effmin Else m_EffortSpace(iflt,i,j)=Effpred
