''' HACK WARNING: This is a place holder ONLY used for the IBM Age 1 forcing
''' There is no IBM biomass layer in the core 
''' We need a placeholder so the IBM forcing will look like other Ecospace Basemap layers, even though it's not.
''' If you need this to work as a cEcospaceBasemap 
''' you will need to construct an array in the core that holds Multi stanza biomass
